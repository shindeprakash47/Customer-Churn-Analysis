Churn Prediction Analysis Project Description:
The churn prediction analysis project is a data-driven initiative aimed at helping businesses understand and mitigate customer churn.
Churn, in this context, refers to customers discontinuing their use of a service or product. 
The project involves:

1. Data Collection: Gathering customer data, transaction records, and related information.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and key factors that contribute to customer churn.
4. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
5. Model Building: Developing machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, to predict which customers are at risk of churning.
6. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
